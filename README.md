# JSON-Server and Redux Toolkit Query App React App

This is a sample app that demonstrates how to use JSON-Server as a mock API and Redux Toolkit Query to fetch data from that API.
## Installation

To install the app, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NarminGale/rtkq-task.git
cd rtkq-task
``` 

Then install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit json-server
```
## Usage

To start the JSON-Server and the app, run the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the JSON-Server on port 3001 and the app on port 3000. You can access the app by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

The app consists of a simple page that displays a list of posts data. The data is fetched from the JSON-Server using Redux Toolkit Query.
